## Resolution Tracking System

### Overview

The resolution tracking system prevents repeated failed automation attempts on exception records, addressing the issue where the exception management flow would attempt to resolve ALL exceptions on every run, including those that had already failed multiple times.

### Problem Solved

**Before:** The exception management flow processed all active exceptions without tracking previous attempts, leading to:
- Wasted computational resources on repeatedly failed attempts
- Noise in logs from repeated failures
- No visibility into processing history
- Potential infinite loops on problematic exceptions

**After:** Smart tracking system that:
- Limits resolution attempts per exception (configurable, default: 2)
- Blocks exceptions after max attempts reached
- Provides full visibility into attempt history
- Prevents processing of blocked exceptions

### Database Schema Changes

#### New Fields in `exceptions` Table

```sql
-- Resolution attempt tracking
resolution_attempts INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
max_resolution_attempts INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 2,
last_resolution_attempt_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
resolution_blocked BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
resolution_block_reason TEXT NULL,

-- New index for efficient querying
CREATE INDEX ix_exceptions_resolution_eligible ON exceptions 
(tenant, status, resolution_attempts, resolution_blocked);
```

### Configuration

#### Environment Variable

```bash
# Set max attempts to 3 (default is 2)
export OCTUP_MAX_RESOLUTION_ATTEMPTS=3

# AI confidence thresholds
AI_MIN_CONFIDENCE=0.7
AI_MIN_SUCCESS_PROBABILITY=0.6
LOW_CONFIDENCE_BLOCK_THRESHOLD=0.3
```

### Model Methods

```python
# Check if exception is eligible for resolution
if exception.is_resolution_eligible:
    # Attempt resolution
    pass

# Increment attempt counter
exception.increment_resolution_attempt()

# Block exception from further attempts
exception.block_resolution("Custom reason")

# Reset tracking (for manual intervention)
exception.reset_resolution_tracking()
```

### Flow Behavior Changes

#### Before Resolution Tracking

```python
# OLD: Processed ALL active exceptions every time
active_exceptions = db.query(ExceptionRecord).filter(
    ExceptionRecord.status.in_(['OPEN', 'IN_PROGRESS'])
).all()

# Result: 174 exceptions processed every run
```

#### After Resolution Tracking

```python
# NEW: Only processes resolution-eligible exceptions
eligible_exceptions = db.query(ExceptionRecord).filter(
    and_(
        ExceptionRecord.status.in_(['OPEN', 'IN_PROGRESS']),
        ExceptionRecord.resolution_blocked == False,
        ExceptionRecord.resolution_attempts < ExceptionRecord.max_resolution_attempts
    )
).all()

# Result: Only new exceptions + those under attempt limit
```

### Blocking Logic

#### Automatic Blocking Conditions

1. **Max Attempts Reached**: After `max_resolution_attempts` failed attempts
2. **Low AI Confidence**: AI confidence < 0.3 (immediate block)
3. **Repeated AI Failures**: Multiple AI analysis failures
4. **Manual Blocking**: Via `block_resolution()` method

#### Block Reasons

- `"Maximum resolution attempts (2) reached"`
- `"AI confidence too low (0.15) - manual review required"`
- `"Repeated AI analysis failures: Connection timeout"`
- Custom reasons via manual blocking

### Performance Impact

#### Database Performance

- **New Index**: Efficient querying of resolution-eligible exceptions
- **Reduced Load**: Fewer exceptions processed per run
- **Better Scaling**: O(new_exceptions) vs O(all_exceptions)

#### Processing Efficiency

**Before:**
- 174 exceptions processed every run
- Repeated AI analysis on same failed cases
- High computational waste

**After:**
- ~20-30 new/eligible exceptions per run
- No repeated processing of blocked exceptions
- 80-85% reduction in unnecessary processing

## Data Enrichment Pipeline

### Executive Summary

The Octup E²A data enrichment pipeline provides **systematic AI-powered data processing** with **guaranteed completeness**, **automatic reprocessing**, and **comprehensive monitoring**. This architecture ensures no data is lost in incomplete states and provides full visibility into enrichment health.

### Critical Problems Solved

#### Before: Dangerous Data Inconsistency
- ❌ Records with `ai_confidence = NULL` were abandoned forever
- ❌ No systematic reprocessing of failed AI enrichment
- ❌ Inconsistent enrichment states across different AI services
- ❌ No visibility into data completeness or quality
- ❌ Silent failures in AI processing pipeline

#### After: Bulletproof Data Pipeline
- ✅ **Systematic Reprocessing**: All failed enrichment is automatically retried
- ✅ **State Tracking**: Complete visibility into enrichment progress
- ✅ **Quality Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and alerting
- ✅ **Failure Recovery**: Robust error handling with escalation
- ✅ **Completeness Guarantee**: No records left in incomplete states

### Sequential Enrichment Pipeline

#### Enrichment Stages (Sequential Dependencies)

1. **Order Analysis** (`ai_order_analyzer`)
   - AI-powered order problem detection
   - Replaces hardcoded pattern matching
   - **Input**: Raw order data
   - **Output**: Problem analysis with confidence scores

2. **Exception Classification** (`ai_exception_analyst`)
   - AI classification of exception types
   - Confidence scoring and labeling
   - **Input**: Exception data + order analysis
   - **Output**: `ai_confidence`, `ai_label`, analysis notes

3. **Automated Resolution** (`ai_automated_resolution`)
   - AI-powered resolution possibility analysis
   - Action recommendation and execution
   - **Input**: Classified exceptions with high confidence
   - **Output**: Resolution analysis and automated actions

### Data State Management

#### Enrichment State Tracking

```python
@dataclass
class EnrichmentState:
    record_id: int
    record_type: str  # "exception" or "order"
    
    # Stage completion status
    order_analysis: EnrichmentStatus = PENDING
    classification: EnrichmentStatus = PENDING  
    automation: EnrichmentStatus = PENDING
    
    # Failure tracking
    last_attempt: Optional[datetime] = None
    retry_count: int = 0
    error_messages: List[str] = []
```

#### Status Values
- `PENDING`: Not yet processed
- `IN_PROGRESS`: Currently being processed
- `COMPLETED`: Successfully completed
- `FAILED`: Failed, needs retry
- `SKIPPED`: Skipped due to conditions (e.g., low confidence)

#### NULL Field Handling (Critical)

**When AI Fails:**
```python
# CORRECT: Set fields to NULL for reprocessing
record.ai_confidence = None
record.ai_label = None

# WRONG: Set default values (masks failures)
record.ai_confidence = 0.0  # ❌ Don't do this!
```

**Reprocessing Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM exception_records 
WHERE ai_confidence IS NULL 
   OR ai_label IS NULL
   OR (ai_confidence < 0.7 AND updated_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours');
```

### Reprocessing Workflow

#### Automatic Reprocessing Triggers

1. **Scheduled Pipeline** (every 4 hours)
   - Identifies records needing enrichment
   - Processes in batches with retry logic
   - Updates enrichment state tracking

2. **Failure Detection** (real-time)
   - Monitors AI service responses
   - Detects NULL field returns
   - Queues for immediate reprocessing

3. **Quality Monitoring** (continuous)
   - Tracks enrichment completeness rates
   - Alerts on quality degradation
   - Triggers manual intervention when needed

#### Retry Strategy

```python
# Exponential backoff with jitter
retry_delays = [1min, 5min, 15min, 1hour, 4hours]
max_retries = 5

# Conditions for retry
if (
    ai_confidence is None or 
    ai_label is None or
    (ai_confidence < 0.7 and retry_count < max_retries)
):
    schedule_retry(record, next_delay)
```

- `exception_rate_health`: Exception rate health component
- `ai_analysis_health`: AI analysis health component
- `sla_compliance_health`: SLA compliance health component

### Alert Thresholds

```python
thresholds = {
    "completeness_critical": 70.0,    # Below 70% = CRITICAL
    "completeness_warning": 85.0,     # Below 85% = WARNING
    "quality_critical": 60.0,         # Below 60% = CRITICAL
    "quality_warning": 80.0,          # Below 80% = WARNING
    "backlog_critical": 1000,         # >1000 pending = CRITICAL
    "failure_rate_critical": 20.0     # >20% failures = CRITICAL
}
```

### Automated Responses

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Prefect Deployment Container Path Issues

**Problem**: Prefect flows crash with `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/Users/sasha/IdeaProjects/octup/root'`

**Root Cause**: Prefect worker runs in Docker container but tries to access local host paths instead of container paths.

**Solution**: Always include proper `pull` steps in `prefect.yaml` to set working directory to `/app`:

```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT - Container-compatible prefect.yaml
name: octup-flows
prefect-version: 3.0.0

build: null
push: null
pull:
  - prefect.deployments.steps.set_working_directory:
      directory: /app  # Container path, not host path

deployments:
  - name: my-flow
    entrypoint: flows/my_flow.py:my_flow_function  # Relative path
    work_pool:
      name: octup-process-pool
      job_variables:
        env:
          PYTHONPATH: /app
```

**❌ WRONG - Will cause crashes:**
```yaml
# Missing pull steps - worker can't find files
pull: null

# Or absolute host paths in entrypoint
entrypoint: /Users/sasha/IdeaProjects/octup/root/flows/my_flow.py:my_flow_function
```

**Key Points**:
- Prefect worker runs in `octup-process-pool` container
- Container working directory must be `/app` (where code is mounted)
- Use relative paths in entrypoints: `flows/my_flow.py:function`
- Always set `PYTHONPATH: /app` in job variables

### Common Issues

#### Resolution tracking not working:
```bash
# Check migration applied
python scripts/apply_resolution_tracking.py

# Verify database schema
psql -c "\d exceptions" | grep resolution
```

#### AI service problems:
```bash
# Check circuit breaker status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/circuit-breakers

# Reset if needed
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/circuit-breakers/ai_service/reset
```

#### Database connection issues:
```bash
# Quick health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Check Supabase status
supabase status
```

#### All exceptions are blocked:
- Check if `max_resolution_attempts` is set too low
- Verify migration was applied correctly
- Review blocking logic for bugs

#### Exceptions not being blocked after failures:
- Verify `increment_resolution_attempt()` is being called
- Check database schema has resolution tracking fields
- Review exception processing flow logic

### Performance Monitoring

```bash
# View system statistics
./run.sh stats

# Check resolution tracking performance
python test_resolution_tracking.py

# Monitor Prometheus metrics
curl http://localhost:8000/metrics | grep resolution
```

### Reset Blocked Exceptions

```sql
-- Reset all blocked exceptions (use carefully!)
UPDATE exceptions 
SET resolution_attempts = 0,
    resolution_blocked = false,
    resolution_block_reason = null,
    last_resolution_attempt_at = null
WHERE resolution_blocked = true;
```

### Quality Assurance Checks

#### Data Integrity Validation

```sql
-- No records should be stuck in incomplete states
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM exception_records 
WHERE ai_confidence IS NULL 
  AND created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day';
-- Should be 0 or very low

-- High confidence rate should be >80%
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ai_confidence >= 0.7) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as high_confidence_rate
FROM exception_records 
WHERE ai_confidence IS NOT NULL;

-- No records should exceed max retry count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM exception_records 
WHERE enrichment_retry_count > 5;
-- Should be 0
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# With coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html

# Specific test categories
pytest tests/unit/          # Unit tests
pytest tests/integration/   # Integration tests
