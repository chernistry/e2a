## System Boundaries

This demo focuses on the core exception processing pipeline and AI integration patterns. The architecture supports extension with additional integrations (WMS/3PL connectors, advanced billing rules, data warehouse ETL) while maintaining the demonstrated reliability and performance characteristics.

The implementation prioritizes demonstrating production-quality patterns for AI integration, resolution tracking, and pipeline observability rather than comprehensive business logic coverage.
