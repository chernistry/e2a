# üé≠ Demo Implementation Notes

This document outlines functions that are simplified for demonstration purposes and would require full implementation in a production environment.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Functions Requiring Production Implementation**

### 1. **Automated Exception Resolution** 
**File:** `flows/exception_management_flow.py:attempt_automated_resolution()`

```python
# Simulate automation attempt
import random
success = random.random() < rule['success_rate']

if success:
    exc.status = 'RESOLVED'
    exc.ops_note = f"Auto-resolved via {rule['action']}"
```

**Current Implementation:** Uses probabilistic simulation to demonstrate automated resolution workflow. Marks exceptions as resolved based on configured success rates.

**Production Requirements:**
- Address validation service integration (Google Maps, USPS, etc.)
- Payment gateway retry mechanisms
- Inventory management system calls
- Carrier API integrations

---

### 2. **Billing Operations Calculation**
**File:** `app/services/billing.py:_calculate_operations_from_events()`

```python
# Calculate storage days (simplified - would be more complex in real system)
if events:
    first_event = min(events, key=lambda e: e.occurred_at)
    last_event = max(events, key=lambda e: e.occurred_at)
    storage_duration = last_event.occurred_at - first_event.occurred_at
    operations["storage_days"] = max(1, storage_duration.days)
```

**Current Implementation:** Demonstrates billing calculation workflow using simplified event-to-operation mapping. Storage duration calculated as first-to-last event timespan.

**Production Requirements:**
- Warehouse management system integration
- Zone-based storage calculations
- Inventory movement tracking
- Complex fee structures (receiving, putaway, cycle counts, etc.)

---

### 3. **SLA Breach Detection Logic**
**File:** `app/services/sla_engine.py:_detect_breaches()`

```python
def _check_pick_sla(self, timeline, sla_config):
    pick_duration = self._calculate_duration_minutes(
        timeline["order_paid"], timeline["pick_completed"]
    )
    pick_sla = sla_config.get("pick_minutes", 120)
    if pick_duration > pick_sla:
        return {"reason_code": "PICK_DELAY", ...}
```

**Current Implementation:** Demonstrates SLA monitoring using time-based thresholds between order events. Provides foundation for breach detection workflow.

**Production Requirements:**
- Business calendar integration
- Warehouse capacity modeling
- Order complexity scoring
- Dynamic SLA adjustments
- Peak season handling

---

### 4. **Invoice Validation**
**File:** `app/services/billing.py:validate_invoice()`

```python
# Get order events to recalculate expected amount
operations = self._calculate_operations_from_events(events)
expected_amount = compute_amount_cents(operations, invoice.tenant)

if invoice.amount_cents != expected_amount:
    # Create adjustment record
```

**Current Implementation:** Demonstrates invoice validation workflow by recalculating amounts from order events and creating adjustment records for discrepancies.

**Production Requirements:**
- Complex rate card management
- Contract-specific pricing
- Volume discount calculations
- Service-level agreements
- Multi-currency support

---

### 5. **Order Problem Detection**
**File:** `app/services/order_analyzer.py:analyze_order()`

```python
def _check_address_issues(self, order):
    zip_code = shipping_address.get("zip", "")
    if zip_code in ["00000", "99999", "INVALID"] or not zip_code:
        return {"reason_code": "ADDRESS_INVALID", ...}
    
    if "Nonexistent" in address1 or city == "Nowhere":
        return {"reason_code": "ADDRESS_INVALID", ...}
```

**Current Implementation:** Demonstrates order validation workflow by detecting obvious test data patterns and invalid address formats.

**Production Requirements:**
- Address validation APIs
- Geocoding services
- Delivery zone validation
- Carrier serviceability checks

---

## ü§î **Additional Demo Simplifications**

### 6. **AI Fallback Responses**
**File:** `app/services/ai_client.py:_make_request()`

```python
except CircuitBreakerError:
    return '{"ai_status": "circuit_open", "ok": false, "label": "OTHER", ...}'
except httpx.TimeoutException:
    return '{"ai_status": "timeout", "ok": false, "label": "OTHER", ...}'
```

**Current Implementation:** Provides hardcoded fallback responses for demonstration of error handling patterns.

**Production Considerations:** More sophisticated fallback logic with context-aware responses.

---

### 7. **Cache Key Generation**
**File:** `app/services/ai_exception_analyst.py:_get_cache_key()`

```python
signature_data = f"{exception.tenant}:{exception.reason_code}:{exception.order_id[-4:]}"
return hashlib.md5(signature_data.encode()).hexdigest()
```

**Current Implementation:** Uses simplified signature for cache key generation suitable for demonstration purposes.

**Production Considerations:** More comprehensive signature including all relevant context for cache invalidation.

---

## ‚úÖ **Appropriate Demo Implementations**

These implementations are suitable for demonstration purposes:

- **Shopify Mock Generator** - Essential for generating realistic demo data
- **SQLite database** - Appropriate database choice for demo vs PostgreSQL  
- **Hardcoded configurations** - Standard practice for demo vs dynamic config
- **Basic metrics** - Simplified metrics suitable for demo vs full Prometheus integration
- **Test data generators** - Required for demo functionality
- **Simplified authentication** - Security complexity not needed for demo
- **Mock external services** - Expected in demo environment

---

## üéØ **Summary**

This document outlines the key areas where the demo implementation uses simplified logic to demonstrate system architecture and workflows. The core infrastructure, patterns, and system design are production-ready, while specific business logic functions use demonstration-appropriate implementations.

For production deployment, these functions would require full implementation with proper external service integrations, complex business rules, and comprehensive validation logic appropriate for a 3PL logistics environment.
