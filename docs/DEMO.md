# Demo Implementation Limitations

This document outlines functions simplified for demonstration purposes and their production requirements.

## Functions Requiring Production Implementation

### 1. AI PII Handling
**File:** `app/services/ai_exception_analyst.py:_prepare_ai_context()`

**Demo Implementation:**
```python
# DEMO: Return raw context without PII redaction
return context
```

**Limitation:** Raw order data (emails, addresses, phone numbers) sent to external AI services without redaction.

**Production Requirements:**
- Comprehensive PII detection and redaction
- Isolated AI environments (on-premises/private cloud)
- Data anonymization preserving analytical value
- GDPR, CCPA compliance

### 2. Billing Operations Calculation
**File:** `app/services/billing.py:_calculate_operations_from_events()`

**Demo Implementation:**
```python
# Simplified storage calculation
storage_duration = last_event.occurred_at - first_event.occurred_at
operations["storage_days"] = max(1, storage_duration.days)
```

**Limitation:** Simplified event-to-operation mapping for demo workflow.

**Production Requirements:**
- WMS integration
- Zone-based storage calculations
- Inventory movement tracking
- Complex fee structures (receiving, putaway, cycle counts)

### 3. SLA Breach Detection Logic
**File:** `app/services/sla_engine.py:_detect_breaches()`

**Demo Implementation:**
```python
def _check_pick_sla(self, timeline, sla_config):
    pick_duration = self._calculate_duration_minutes(
        timeline["order_paid"], timeline["pick_completed"]
    )
    if pick_duration > sla_config.get("pick_minutes", 120):
        return {"reason_code": "PICK_DELAY", ...}
```

**Limitation:** Basic time-based SLA checks without warehouse complexity.

**Production Requirements:**
- Multi-tier SLA configurations
- Dynamic threshold adjustments
- Warehouse capacity considerations
- Peak season handling
- Customer-specific SLA agreements

### 4. Data Validation Rules
**File:** `app/services/data_completeness_service.py`

**Demo Implementation:**
- Basic field presence checks
- Simple format validation
- Hardcoded business rules

**Production Requirements:**
- Dynamic validation rule engine
- Industry-specific compliance checks
- Real-time validation with external systems
- Configurable validation severity levels

### 5. Exception Pattern Recognition
**File:** `app/services/ai_exception_analyst.py`

**Demo Implementation:**
- Limited pattern matching
- Basic categorization
- Simple confidence scoring

**Production Requirements:**
- Machine learning-based pattern recognition
- Historical trend analysis
- Predictive exception modeling
- Advanced root cause analysis

### 6. Automated Resolution Actions
**File:** `app/services/ai_automated_resolution.py`

**Demo Implementation:**
- Simulated resolution actions
- Basic success/failure responses
- Limited integration points

**Production Requirements:**
- Real WMS/ERP system integration
- Multi-step resolution workflows
- Rollback capabilities
- Human approval workflows for high-impact actions

## Demo Data Limitations

### Order Event Generation
- **Demo**: Synthetic order events with predictable patterns
- **Production**: Real-time webhook integration with e-commerce platforms

### AI Model Usage
- **Demo**: Free-tier AI models with rate limits
- **Production**: Enterprise AI models with guaranteed SLAs

### Database Scale
- **Demo**: Small dataset for quick demonstration
- **Production**: Multi-tenant architecture with millions of records

### Monitoring & Alerting
- **Demo**: Basic console logging and simple metrics
- **Production**: Comprehensive observability stack with real-time alerting

## Architecture Simplifications

### Service Integration
- **Demo**: In-process service calls
- **Production**: Microservices with proper service mesh

### Error Handling
- **Demo**: Basic try/catch with logging
- **Production**: Comprehensive error handling with circuit breakers

### Security
- **Demo**: Basic authentication
- **Production**: OAuth2, RBAC, audit logging, encryption at rest

### Scalability
- **Demo**: Single-instance deployment
- **Production**: Auto-scaling, load balancing, multi-region deployment

## Getting Production Ready

To move from demo to production:

1. **Implement PII redaction** before AI processing
2. **Integrate with real WMS/ERP systems** for billing calculations
3. **Enhance SLA engine** with business-specific rules
4. **Add comprehensive validation** with configurable rules
5. **Implement real resolution actions** with proper integrations
6. **Scale infrastructure** for production load
7. **Add security layers** for enterprise deployment
8. **Implement comprehensive monitoring** and alerting

See [KB.MD](KB.MD) for detailed implementation guidance.
