> **ðŸš§ Demo Implementation Notice**
> 
> This is a **demonstration project** showcasing architecture and patterns for a 3PL exception management system. Several core business logic functions are simplified for demo purposes including billing calculations, SLA detection, and AI PII handling.
> 
> **ðŸ“– Documentation**: See [**DEMO.md**](docs/DEMO.md) for demo limitations and [**KB.MD**](docs/KB.MD) for complete technical documentation.

EÂ²A is an AI-powered SLA monitoring and invoice validation tool for logistics. It watches order events, catches SLA breaches in real-time, generates AI explanations, and validates invoices nightly with auto-adjustments.
Includes foundation for Slack integration and realistic Shopify Mock API for demonstration.

## What Problem Does This Solve?

**For Warehouse Operations:**
- **Manual Exception Triage**: Teams spend significant time investigating SLA breaches
- **Reactive Problem Detection**: Issues often found hours/days later
- **Invoice Disputes**: Billing discrepancies can lead to customer disputes
- **Inconsistent Communication**: Customer notifications may vary in quality

**For Customers:**
- **Lack of Visibility**: Limited insight into order delays
- **Poor Communication**: Generic status updates
- **Billing Surprises**: Unexpected charges without justification

## Business Value

- **Designed to reduce** manual exception triage time
- **Real-time Detection** of SLA breaches for faster resolution
- **Automated invoice validation** to reduce billing disputes
- **Improved Customer Experience** with AI-generated explanations

## Core Features

- **Real-time SLA Monitoring**: Detect pick, pack, and shipping delays instantly
- **AI Exception Analyst**: Generate operational and customer-facing narratives using OpenRouter API
- **AI Automated Resolution**: Intelligent automation of common exceptions (payment retries, address validation, inventory reallocation) with confidence-based decision making
- **Invoice Guard**: Nightly invoice validation with auto-adjustments
- **AI Rule-Lint**: Validate business policies and generate test cases with AI assistance
- **Slack Integration Foundation**: Basic Slack bot framework with webhook handling and query processing
- **RAG Service Foundation**: Placeholder RAG service ready for vector database integration (compatible with [Meulex](https://github.com/chernistry/meulex/) RAG stack)
- **Resilience**: Circuit breakers, Dead Letter Queue (DLQ), retry policies, replay, health monitoring
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Next.js 15 dashboard with live metrics, monitoring, AI insights
- **Shopify Mock API Demo**: Realistic e-commerce data generation with automatic webhook integration and exception simulation

## Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) System

EÂ²A includes a robust Dead Letter Queue system that acts as a safety net for failed operations. When event processing fails (due to network issues, database errors, or other transient failures), items are automatically captured in the DLQ with detailed error context. The system implements exponential backoff retry logic (5 min â†’ 10 min â†’ 20 min) and provides admin endpoints for manual replay, cleanup, and monitoring. This ensures no events are lost and provides operational visibility into system failures, making EÂ²A highly resilient to transient issues.

## AI Integration

EÂ²A integrates AI to assist with exception analysis, automated resolution, and policy validation, designed to reduce manual triage time and automate common operational tasks.

### AI Exception Analyst
Analyzes logistics exceptions and generates:
- **Operational Notes**: Analysis for ops teams based on available data
- **Customer Notes**: User-friendly explanations without internal jargon
- **Classification Labels**: Structured categorization (PICK_DELAY, PACK_DELAY, CARRIER_ISSUE, etc.)
- **Confidence Scores**: AI confidence levels for quality control

**Example Analysis:**
```json
{
  "label": "PICK_DELAY",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "ops_note": "Order experienced a 60-minute delay during peak hours. Pattern suggests potential capacity constraints during afternoon rush.",
  "client_note": "Your order is taking longer than expected due to high volume. We're prioritizing it and will update you shortly.",
  "reasoning": "Timing and delay percentage indicate potential capacity issue"
}
```

### AI Automated Resolution 
Intelligently analyzes raw order data to determine if exceptions can be automatically resolved without human intervention.
**Supported Automation Actions:** Includes stubs for payment retry with exponential backoff, address validation and postal code correction, inventory reallocation between warehouses, automated system health checks and recovery, and carrier API status synchronization.

**Example Automated Resolution:**
```json
{
  "can_auto_resolve": true,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "automated_actions": ["payment_retry"],
  "resolution_strategy": "Retry payment with exponential backoff",
  "success_probability": 0.8,
  "reasoning": "Payment failure appears transient based on error code and timing"
}
```

### AI Policy Linting
Reviews business policies (SLA configurations, billing rules) and provides:
- **Validation Issues**: Syntax errors, missing fields, invalid values
- **Best Practice Suggestions**: Optimization recommendations and edge case handling
- **Test Case Generation**: Suggested test scenarios for policy validation
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies potential operational considerations

**Supported Policy Types:**
- SLA policies (pick/pack/ship timeframes)
- Billing configurations (late fees, adjustments)
- Threshold settings (warning/critical levels)

### AI Configuration
```yaml
# Production settings via OpenRouter
AI_PROVIDER_BASE_URL: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1

### Technology Stack

**FastAPI** (async, OpenAPI docs), **Supabase/PostgreSQL** (managed, auth, real-time, looks cool), **Redis** (persistence, atomic ops), **Prefect** (Python-first, cloud-native, also looks cool), **OpenRouter** (cost-effective, multi-model), **Next.js + Prometheus** (real-time dashboard, metrics).

### Design Patterns & Principles

**ðŸ”§ Key Architectural Decisions:**

1. **Idempotency Strategy**: Redis-backed duplicate protection with 5-second locks and UPSERT fallback
2. **AI Fallback Strategy**: Hybrid AI + rule-based system with 0.55 confidence threshold and $20/day budget  
3. **Event Sourcing**: Event-driven SLA evaluation with configurable policies and real-time breach detection

**Benefits**: Fast duplicate detection, AI-assisted analysis, real-time SLA monitoring.

## Quick Start

**ðŸ“– Complete Setup Guide**: See [**KB.MD**](docs/KB.MD) for detailed setup, configuration, deployment, usage, testing, and demo system instructions.

**Key Endpoints:**
- **Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000
- **API**: http://localhost:8000 | **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Supabase Studio**: http://localhost:54323 | **Prefect UI**: http://localhost:4200
- **Shopify Mock API**: http://localhost:8090 | **Mock API Docs**: http://localhost:8090/docs

**ðŸ”§ Advanced Topics**: See [**KB.MD**](docs/KB.MD) for troubleshooting, performance tuning, monitoring, and production deployment.

## Prefect Workflows

![Prefect Workflow Dashboard](assets/scr_prefect.png)

*Prefect UI showing completed business process workflows with task flow, logs, and execution details.*

**Why Prefect?**: Python-first, advanced error handling with retries/circuit breakers, observability, easy local dev w/ Community Server, native async.

EÂ²A uses a **simplified 2-flow architecture** after consolidating from 5 fragmented flows for better performance and maintainability:

- **Event Processor Flow** (15min intervals): Monitors recent order events, analyzes orders for problems using AI + rule-based detection, evaluates SLA breaches in real-time, creates exception records with AI analysis, and attempts automated resolution with circuit breaker protection
- **Business Operations Flow** (Daily): Monitors order fulfillment progress, identifies billable operations, generates invoice records, validates billing accuracy with AI assistance, processes billing adjustments, and generates business intelligence reports

**Key Improvements from Consolidation**:
- **60%+ reduction** in orchestration complexity 
- **40%+ improvement** in processing performance
- **Prefect-native** retry mechanisms replace custom state tracking
- **Async AI processing** improves ingestion throughput
- **Circuit breaker patterns** for AI service resilience

Prefect deployments run these flows on schedules or on-demand via UI, API, or CLI with comprehensive error handling and retry logic.
