# ==== PREFECT FLOWS PACKAGE ==== #

"""
Modern Prefect flows for Octup EÂ²A business operations.

This package contains realistic business process flows that work with
webhook-driven architecture:

- order_processing_flow: End-to-end order fulfillment monitoring
- exception_management_flow: Proactive exception handling and resolution
- billing_management_flow: Comprehensive invoice generation and validation
- business_operations_orchestrator: Master coordination of all processes

These flows replace the old event streaming approach with realistic
business processes that respond to webhook events from Shopify Mock.
