# Octup E¬≤A Business Process Flows

This directory contains modern Prefect flows that implement realistic business processes for e-commerce operations. These flows replace the old event streaming approach with webhook-driven business logic.

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Overview**

The new flow architecture is designed around real-world business processes:

```
Shopify Mock (Webhooks) ‚Üí API (Event Processing) ‚Üí Prefect Flows (Business Logic)
```

### **Flow Hierarchy**

1. **Business Operations Orchestrator** (Master)
   - Coordinates all business processes
   - Handles scheduling and dependencies
   - Provides comprehensive reporting

2. **Order Processing Flow** (Hourly)
   - Monitors order fulfillment progress
   - Identifies completed orders
   - Tracks SLA compliance

3. **Exception Management Flow** (Every 4 hours)
   - Analyzes exception patterns
   - Prioritizes active exceptions
   - Attempts automated resolution

4. **Billing Management Flow** (Daily)
   - Generates invoices for completed orders
   - Validates invoice accuracy
   - Processes billing adjustments

### **4. Business Operations Orchestrator**
**File:** `business_operations_orchestrator.py`
**Schedule:** Configurable (hourly/daily modes)
**Purpose:** Master coordination of all business processes

**Key Tasks:**
- `check_system_readiness()` - Verify system health
- `determine_operation_schedule()` - Intelligent scheduling
- `execute_*_operations()` - Coordinated execution
- `generate_operations_summary()` - Executive reporting

**Business Value:**
- Ensures proper process sequencing
- Provides operational visibility
- Handles error recovery and reporting

## üöÄ **Usage Examples**

### **Running Individual Flows**

```bash
# Order Processing (1 hour lookback)
python flows/order_processing_flow.py --run --hours 1

# Exception Management (1 week analysis)
python flows/exception_management_flow.py --run --hours 168

# Billing Management (24 hour lookback)
python flows/billing_management_flow.py --run --hours 24

# Full Orchestration
python flows/business_operations_orchestrator.py --run --mode full
```

### **Testing All Flows**

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
python test_flows.py
```

### **Integration with run.sh**

The flows integrate with the existing `run.sh` script:

```bash
# Generate data and run flows
./run.sh demo                    # Generate demo data
./run.sh generate batch          # Generate batch of orders
python test_flows.py             # Test all flows
```

## üìä **Real-World Business Logic**

### **Invoice Generation Process**

1. **Order Completion Detection**
   - Monitors for fulfillment events (`order_fulfilled`, `order_shipped`, `order_delivered`)
   - Verifies no blocking exceptions exist
   - Calculates billable operations

2. **Invoice Creation**
   - Generates unique invoice numbers (`DEMO-3PL-202508-0001`)
   - Calculates amounts based on operations performed
   - Sets payment terms and due dates

3. **Validation & Adjustments**
   - Recalculates amounts from source events
   - Creates adjustments for discrepancies
   - Maintains audit trail

### **Exception Management Logic**

1. **Pattern Analysis**
   - Identifies recurring issues and root causes
   - Analyzes time-based patterns (peak hours, days)
   - Calculates resolution performance metrics

2. **Smart Prioritization**
   - Considers severity, age, and business impact
   - Identifies SLA risk and critical issues
   - Provides actionable priority queues

3. **Automated Resolution**
   - Implements automation rules for common issues
   - Tracks success rates and improvements
   - Escalates complex issues to humans

### **SLA Compliance Tracking**

- **4-hour response SLA** for exception resolution
- **72-hour delivery SLA** for order fulfillment
- **Real-time compliance monitoring** and alerting
- **Trend analysis** for continuous improvement

## üîß **Configuration**

### **Environment Variables**

```bash
# Database connection
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://...

# Tenant configuration
DEFAULT_TENANT=demo-3pl

# Business rules
SLA_RESPONSE_HOURS=4
SLA_DELIVERY_HOURS=72
INVOICE_PAYMENT_TERMS_DAYS=30
```

### **Scheduling Configuration**

The orchestrator uses intelligent scheduling based on:
- **Business hours:** 9 AM - 5 PM for non-critical operations
- **Maintenance windows:** 3-4 AM for system maintenance
- **Load balancing:** Distributes operations across time slots

## üìà **Monitoring & Observability**

### **Key Metrics**

- **Order Processing:** Completion rate, SLA compliance, throughput
- **Exception Management:** Resolution rate, automation success, response time
- **Billing:** Invoice accuracy, adjustment rate, revenue processed
- **Overall:** System health, operation success rate, performance trends

### **Reporting**

Each flow generates comprehensive reports including:
- **Executive summaries** with key metrics
- **Operational insights** and recommendations
- **Performance trends** and comparisons
- **Error analysis** and root cause identification

## üîÑ **Migration from Old Flows**

### **Replaced Flows**

- ‚ùå `event_streaming.py` - Replaced by webhook-driven processing
- ‚ùå `invoice_validate_nightly.py` - Integrated into billing management flow

### **Key Improvements**

1. **Realistic Business Logic:** Flows now mirror actual e-commerce operations
2. **Webhook Integration:** Works with Shopify Mock webhook events
3. **Comprehensive Reporting:** Executive-level insights and recommendations
4. **Error Handling:** Robust error recovery and reporting
